      <p>
        Our total material costs per item are $40. The camera costs $17, the contact sensor costs $4, the microcontroller costs $15 (Pi Zero), and casing materials and assembly cost 4 dollars per unit (this will scale down with economies of scale).
        Additionally, we have a few fixed costs that do not scale with market size (or scale very little): server hosting costs $30-$50 a month, and the ClarifAI API used for image classification costs $30 a month.

      <h1 class="subtitle">Revenue</h1>
      <p>
        Our revenue model centers on an online sale model, with units selling for $65 a piece. We would suplement this with advertising revenue (average $0.02 per impression) which could be replaced with a subscription plan of $1 a month to turn off adverts.
        We expect to sell 5000 units a year, leading to $325,000 a year in sales. We expect our advertising to bring in $0.02*(1 impression per app use)*(2 to 3 app uses per week)*(52 weeks) = $2.6 per year for advertised users. For those who take the subscription plan we would have a revenue of $12 per user per year.
        If we assume 90% of users will stay with the advertising plan, that gives us a total anual net revenue of 325000+(0.9*5000*2.6)+(0.1*5000*12) - 200000-960 =  342700-200960 = $141740.
