        The Grocery Tracker is a camera pod you can attach to your fridge / storage space which takes pictures of what you put in / take out of storage when you open the door.
        It then sends these pictures to our cloud processing server which determines what grocery item was just handled and updates your profile in our Web-app.
        From the Web-app, you can tell what is in your storage space and how long ago it was first put there. The app will occasionally ask you to check if a product is empty (usually after it has been removed and replaced multiple times).
        If the app does not recognize an item, it gives it a placeholder name which you can change at will.
