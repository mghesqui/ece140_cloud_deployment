        The Grocery Tracker is a camera pod you can attach to your fridge / storage space which takes pictures of what you put in / take out of storage when you open the door.
        It then sends these pictures to our cloud processing server which determines what grocery item was just handled and updates your profile in our Web-app.
        From the Web-app, you can tell what is in your storage space and how long ago it was first put there. The app will occasionally ask you to check if a product is empty (usually after it has been removed and replaced multiple times).
        If the app does not recognize an item, it gives it a placeholder name which you can change at will.

      <h1 class="subtitle"> Hick's Law </h1>
      <div>
        <p class="content"> Hick's Law states that the time required to make a decision grows with the number of options presented. An example of a UI which takes Hick's Law into account
        is Amazon's home page. While there are many options which need to be presented to the user in order for experienced users to have full control, the user's attention is drawn to the search bar as the primary option.
        This reduces the complexity of the choice.

      <h1 class="subtitle"> Law of Proximity </h1>
      <div>
        <p class="content"> The Law of Proximity states that people will see options located near each other to be related, even if not intended. An example of a UI which takes the law of proximity into account is the Google landing page.
          The top right of the page includes links and menus related to other google services (not search). The top left of the page includes the more commercial part of the website. The bottom left contains the options for businesses, and the bottom right contains legal discalimers and settings.
          The center is kept for the main search functionality and the company logo. This spacial organization helps make their landing page easier to parse, by grouping links to similar services.

      <h1 class="subtitle">Miller's Law </h1>
      <div>
        <p class="content">Miller's Law states that you should be mindful of how many things the user can keep in mind at once. The law posits that this amount is 7+-2. An example of a UI which takes Miller's Law into account is the craigslist item list. Once you make a search, items are listed in rows of 3, and each item is seperated from others by white space.
          The information regarding each item is also kept below the threshold, with most items having between 6 and 9 things to remember depending on the complexity of the posting title. This helps the user digest the information in bitesized chuncks rather than all at once.
