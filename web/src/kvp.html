        Our Grocery Tracker helps home cooks and grocery shoppers who want to save on groceries (eg: at the store), by reducing how often they buy something they already had, and allowing them to see exactly what they are missing.
        Unlike smart fridges, we do not require you to buy entire new appliances. Unlike reciept tracker apps, we keep track of what you have, not just what you have bought, and update our model when you remove an item from the fridge.
