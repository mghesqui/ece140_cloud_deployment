        The Problem:
      </h1>
      <p class="content">
        Have you ever been at the grocery store and wondered: "Do I have bread left?" or "How old is my milk". Grocery Tracker aims to make it easy for you to check what groceries you have, and whether they're still good, no matter where you are.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">
        The Solution:
      </h1>
      <p class="content">
        Grocery Tracker uses camera pods placed in your fridge / freezer / storage space to track your groceries as you get and use them. Our web-app lets you track which groceries you currently have, and how long ago you bought them. You can also set it up to automatically order certain groceries when you run out.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">
        Is This for you?
      </h1>
      <p class="content">
        Grocery Tracker is designed to be used in any basic fridge or storage space, and is substantially cheaper than an entire smart-fridge or similar products, at only $60 a unit. If you would like to avoid buying something you already have, or often forget to buy something you thought you had, then Grocery Tracker is for you.
