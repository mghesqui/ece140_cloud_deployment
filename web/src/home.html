        The Problem:
      </h1>
      <p class="content">
        Have you ever been at the grocery store and wondered: "Do I have bread left?" or "How old is my milk". Grocery Tracker aims to make it easy for you to check what groceries you have, and whether they're still good, no matter where you are.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">
        The Solution:
      </h1>
      <p class="content">
        Grocery Tracker uses camera pods placed in your fridge / freezer / storage space to track your groceries as you get and use them. Our web-app lets you track which groceries you currently have, and how long ago you bought them. You can also set it up to automatically order certain groceries when you run out.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">
        Is This for you?
      </h1>
      <p class="content">
        Grocery Tracker is designed to be used in any basic fridge or storage space, and is substantially cheaper than an entire smart-fridge or similar products, at only $60 a unit. If you would like to avoid buying something you already have, or often forget to buy something you thought you had, then Grocery Tracker is for you.

      <p class="content">
        This week some changes were made to the website to improve the User Experience. The menu was given extra padding to keep it away from the edge of the screen. The buttons backgrounds were given a color to be more easily distinguishable. All text boxes were given extra padding to avoid clumping too close to the edge of the screen. All of these improve visibility.

      <h1 class="subtitle">Features and Benefits</h1>
      <p></p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">App displays list of grocery items in frisge</h1>
      <p class="content">
        By displaying this information in a mobile application, we allow our users the benefit of always knowing what groceries they already have, simply by checking their phone.
        This feature benefits all our users as it is the core functionality of the product.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">Camera runs automated Computer Vision</h1>
      <p class="content">
        The user does not have to change their routine at all for the product to work, simply place the item in the fridge and our product keeps track of it.
        This feature benefits the users actually storing the goods in the fridge. In some instances these are not the customers (household with multiple shoppers), but it helps the product stay out of the user's way.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">Search type of item</h1>
      <p class="content">
        Allows users to see a list of all items in one category (eg. fruits), without cluttering their brainspace with other irrelevent groceries.
        This feature mainly benefits cooks or grocery shoppers who need to split grocery items by category to make sure they can prepare a dish.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">Search Items by location</h1>
      <p class="content">
        Allows the users to find items quickly if they know they have it but don't know which fridge/ cupboard its in.
        This feature mostly benefits the cooks, who need to know where the shoppers placed the items.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">Keeps track of how long a product has been in fridge / cupboard</h1>
      <p class="content">
        Lets the user keep track of expired goods so they don't come home to rotten groceries they thought were still good.
        This feature benefits all the users for different reasons. The shoppers get to know when they should buy more of something, and the cooks can check whether an item is still safe to eat.

      <h1 class="subtitle">Product Interactions</h1>
      <p></p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">Storing groceries</h1>
      <p class="content">
        When the user is storing groceries, our product wants to stay out of the way, while still keeping track of what is being stored. This is acheived by placing the camera at an angle where it sees the user add the items without the user needing to do anything unusual.
        The camera also automatically records whenever the door is open, so there is no need to press an on switch.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">Browsing Contents</h1>
      <p class="content">
        The list of grocery items is displayed in the app in text form, and is as such accessible from anywhere. The list is searchable, sortable, and filterable to make sure the user gets the information they need as easily as possible.
        Each item is listed with its age, count, and location to allow the user to easily plan around these factors when shopping or cooking.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subtitle">Removing Contents</h1>
      <p class="content">
        Similarly to storing contents, we want the product to stay out of the way during this interaction. As such, it functions much the same as when storing contents, but simply also keeps track of the direction of motion.
        This helps our product integrate seamlessly into our user's everyday lives.
